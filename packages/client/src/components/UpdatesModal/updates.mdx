- ### Bug Fixes

  Bonus Reader and Clue Generator have been fixed! These pages broke during a
  package upgrade and unfortunately, I got wrapped up in school/work stuff. So
  sorry about the inconvenience. There was also an issue with the positioning of
  the rendered bell icon <Bell /> when buzzing that should be fixed as well.

- ### Shared Monorepo
  The old client and server codebases have been merged into a
  [monorepo](https://github.com/yesean/qbhub). It's not that important for end
  users, but the monorepo, along with some upgrades to the build tooling,
  simplifies a lot of things, which means new features should be pushed faster
  now!
- ### Updates Modal
  A brand new **Updates** page! This page will periodically announce new QBHub
  features and updates as well as upcoming goals for the future releases. This
  page will only automatically open whenever a new update is released, but can
  be accessed anytime by clicking the <InfoButton /> button in the bottom left
  corner.

## Upcoming

- ### Error Reporting System

Users would be able to report bugs or submit feature requests, including
question specific errors (formatting issues, incorrect labels). This lets bugs
like the frozen Bonus Reader get discovered and resolved as soon as possible!
For the time being, you can still leave comments on
[this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmLBEXd_p_j_t8M7qvGGC5fC5_B0a0DKCWy6K7YWjOyHA7Hg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

- ### Advanced Stats

In-depth stats and graphs (per category, celerity, etc) to give a detailed
overview of a playing session and to be able to identify strengths and
weaknesses in gameplay. This was actually one of my original goals for QBHub, it
got put aside for more important things.
