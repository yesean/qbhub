### Improved URLs

Question settings (category, subcategory, difficulty, etc) are now stored in the
URL, meaning URLs are now shareable and will restore the question settings from
a previous session! Settings will still be saved locally in
[local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
and restored if a URL without question settings, such as
[qbhub.io/tossup](https://qbhub.io), is provided.

### Revamped Question Reader

The question reader (used for the tossup/bonus reader) has been rewritten from
the ground up, bringing performance improvements and a snappier user experience.
Overall, the reader should operate similarly as before, with some UX touchups
here and there.

### CPU Override <OverrideIconButton />

You can now override the automated scoring system by clicking the button, after
an answer has been judged.

### Redesigned Question History <HistoryIconButton />

The question history modal has been redesigned to be more responsive and
pleasing to use, especially compared to the previous version. Additionally, you
can view your score trends under the new **Line Chart** tab. More advanced
visualizations and analytics are planned for the future.

### Clue Generator Autocompletion

The clue generator now searches for answers while you type, making it easier to
discover answerlines and potential clues!

### Bug Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

- Bonus Reader and Clue Generator have been fixed! These pages broke during a
  package upgrade and unfortunately, I got wrapped up in school/work stuff.
  Sorry about the inconvenience.
- Positioning of the rendered bell icon <Bell /> when buzzing is fixed.

### Monorepo + Vite ‚ö°Ô∏è

The old client and server codebases have been migrated to a
[monorepo](https://github.com/yesean/qbhub). This change shouldn't really affect
end users aside from the fact that the monorepo, along with some
[upgrades to the build tooling](https://vitejs.dev/), simplifies a lot of
things, which means new features will be pushed out faster now!

### Updates Modal üí°

A brand new **Updates** page! This page will periodically announce new QBHub
features and updates as well as upcoming goals for the future releases. This
page will only automatically open whenever a new update is released, but can be
accessed anytime by clicking the info button
{/* prettier-ignore */} <InfoOutlineIcon mx={1} /> in the bottom left corner.
Note, the old keyboard shortcuts modal has moved to the
{/* prettier-ignore */} <QuestionOutlineIcon mx={1} /> button.

## Upcoming üìà

### Error Reporting System üì•

Users will be able to report bugs and submit feature requests, including
question specific errors (formatting issues, incorrect labels). This will allow
me to discover bugs and resolve them as soon as possible! It's going to be a
pretty big effort and could take a while so for the time being, you can still
leave comments on
[this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmLBEXd_p_j_t8M7qvGGC5fC5_B0a0DKCWy6K7YWjOyHA7Hg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
or [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/yesean/qbhub/issues/new/choose).

### Advanced Stats üìä

In-depth stats and graphs (per category, celerity, etc) to give a detailed
overview of a playing session and to be able to identify strengths and
weaknesses in gameplay. This was actually one of my original goals for QBHub,
but it got put aside in favor of more important things.

### Clue Generator Improvements

Planning to improve the quality of generated clues: _reducing_ duplication,
_discarding_ unuseful information, and _speeding_ up the generation process. I'm
taking an ML class on NLP / text mining this quarter, which has given me some
ideas on optimizing the existing QBHub algorithm! Not sure how much quantifiable
progress there will be, but it's something I plan on investing some time into.
