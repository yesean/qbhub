    text: replaceLinks`With the compilation of the QuizDB database, there was potential for useful features but the existing Quizbowl resources lacked what I envisioned. QuizDB is an excellent question browser but lacks interactivity, Protobowl has a great question reader but lacks packet selection and has a clunky interface, and other sites seemed similarly lacking in various regards. The amount of technology-driven QB tooling felt lacking, especially when you consider the huge amount of data and computional power that exists today. Prior to QBHub, I developed a few text processing utilities that I wanted to port to a more accessible interface like the web. More importantly, QBHub seemed like a fun project to try out some new technologies (Redux, ChakraUI) and polish my web dev skills. Originally, QBHub was planned to be a simple tossup reader with a ${{
      label: 'typings.gg-like',
      href: 'https://typings.gg/',
    }} interface, but the more I worked on it, the more I enjoyed it. As a result, I began adding more features, eventually morphing QBHub into what it is now.`,
